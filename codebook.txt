Description

The tidy_data contains the tidy dataset that has been created by combining train and test data, activity labels and subjects data in one dataset. It is derived from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, where the data were collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope of a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone worn by 30 subjects while performing six different activities.

The summary data contains the average of each variable from tidy_data for each activity and each subject. 

Variables
Activity: The activity performed by the subject.

Type: Factor
Levels:
WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING
Subject: The identifier of the subject who performed the activity.

Type: Integer
Range: 1 to 30
